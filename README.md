Why is my save not working in-game?
 - the in-app "filename" section has to match the *actual file name* of the file you exported.
   E.g, you can't have the filename section set to "my_awesome_save.sav", and name it "save_file_game.sav" and expect it to work.

   This could also be because you set values too high. Caps for number values can range between 127, and 9 quadrillion...

I have a ".py" file, and double-clicking doesn't work!
  - Please refer to the "How to use" section. The .py is code, and not an executable file you can double-click and run

Can I contribute?
